                     the Šmarje District based in Rogaška Slatina. The main reason behind the
                     annexation was industry – the glassworks Straža in Hum was highly advanced at

                     heavily guarded its banks and enclosed it with barbed wire and minefields.
                     Nevertheless, smuggling soon emerged across the river. Most sought after

                     dealt one of the hardest blows. On that day, after capturing and torturing a
                     local to get information, German troops crammed 27 poor glassworkers into their
                     lorries in front of the glassworks, and took them to the Stari pisker prison.

                     time-consuming and often made difficult because the cultural landscape has

                     residents had to stay with their neighbours. They fortified the houses and
                     outbuildings and made a genuine little fortress. There is a sketch in the top
                     left corner while the reverse of the same document contains a detailed
                     description of the post – the picture on the right. The document must have been
                     created after November 1942, most likely in the spring or early summer of 1943.
                     In the two-page document, partisan informants drew a sketch and wrote down
                     detailed information about the garrison. The document is kept by the Archives
                     of the Republic of Slovenia. The two pictures below show the demolition of
                     bunkers in front of the house of the Čadonič family at the address Dolnje Zilje
                     42 (the locals called it the Markovi residence) after Italy had capitulated,
                     most likely in September 1943 before the German Offensive. The picture on the
                     left is the property of Janez Uršič, while the picture on the right belongs to
                     the National Museum of Contemporary History. The authors are unknown.</a></li><li><a href="exh04-en-ch08.html#figure-123-en">Until the summer of 1942, the locals got along with the Italians, more or
                     less. The Italians did not mistreat the villagers. They allegedly even paid
                     them for the chickens they wanted for lunch, or for washing their linen and
                     clothing. Some of the Italian soldiers were said to have been Slovenes from the
                     Primorska region, because the locals could easily communicate with them. The
                     picture shows a few villagers with soldiers from the garrison. One of the
                     soldiers is allegedly a man named Rocco, who returned to the village for a
                     visit twenty years after the war had ended. Jože Starešinič told us about his

                     From 1938 until he died in 1945, he served in the newly-created parish of

                     authorities in the autumn of 1941 and charged for collaboration with the
                     Communists. After nine months, he was released from prison and was allowed to
                     return to his congregation. When he was returning from Dolnja Lendava in the
                     evening hours of March 16, 1945, strangers grabbed him near Hotiza, brutally
                     beat him and dragged him to Mura, where he was shot in the head and thrown into

                     that led to the border, our space unfolded, until a guarded border closed it
                     after the war when we were already in school. They put up wire, a wire fence.
                     These were two kinds of barbed wire maybe two meters high, or even more. Now
                     and then, there was a guard tower. It seemed strange to us, of course, because
                     both that road and socializing with children from Őriszentpéter on the other
                     side of the border were hindered. I especially found it strange because I used
                     to drive to those villages with my grandfather in his cart. Suddenly, that was
