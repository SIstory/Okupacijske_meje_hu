Namely, the final deadline for abandoning the use of Slovene signs and place names (villages, streets, road and railway crossings, inns, signposts, etc.) and bilingualism was 15 June 1941. In Ptuj, bilingualism was abolished as early as April. At the glassworks, Nazi appeals were also translated into Croatian because of the large number of Croatian-speaking glassworkers.</p><div class="chapter" id="en-exh02-ch03-subch01"><h4><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="OKPM2-head-275">Confiscations, Exiles and Deportations to Camps</span></h4><p id="OKPM2-p-174">In this resort town, in accordance with the desire to annihilate the Slovene nation, the Nazis quickly carried out mass arrests and torture, and exiled people across the southernmost border of the Reich. Orders to detain and confiscate were issued by the branch of the German Intelligence Service (SD) in Rogaška Slatina, in cooperation with the Gestapo. As early as 29 April, a Jewish person was exiled across the Sotla River. A report dated 3 June reveals that, besides Jews, the deportation list mainly included the aware, educated and previously politically active inhabitants of Rogaška Slatina, followed by immigrants after 1914 (the latter were censused on 27 April, when 2,005 immigrants were recorded). After being tortured in temporary detention centres, their final destinations were usually the Ustasha Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and Serbia. Quite a few families from Rogaška Slatina ended up in concentration camps. Their property was, of course, confiscated. Reports from the Rogaška Slatina Gendarmerie Station reveal that between the seizure of power and 3 June 1941, the occupying forces immediately exiled 26 persons from the town and made many more temporary arrests. Due to acts of treason at clandestine meetings in Graz (where the volksdeutscher from Rogaška Slatina were also present), many lists for arrests in Rogaška Slatina were written directly in Berlin and Graz even before the German attack.</p></div><div class="chapetr" id="en-exh02-ch03-subch02"><h4><span class="head" itemprop="head" id="OKPM2-head-276">Labour and Military Conscription</span></h4><p id="OKPM2-p-175">The first defeats on the Eastern Front in December 1941 forced Germany to conscript an additional military and labour force, and to increase the utilisation of raw materials in the occupied areas. As its soldiers were leaving for the battlefields, the increasingly burdened German industry was experiencing a shortage of workers, which was why Germany introduced a compulsory and uniformed Reich Labour Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst/RAD) and compulsory military service in the occupied territory of Lower Styria as early as the spring of 1942. This major violation of international law was simply ignored. By May 1943 alone, around 20,000 workers were dragged to work from the Slovene part of Styria, and more than 28,000 Styrian men were conscripted into the German Army before it capitulated. The conscripts from Rogaška Slatina were scattered across nearly every battlefield. Most of them were sent to the Eastern Front (the largest theatre of war in Europe), which, besides Russia, also included Poland, Hungary, Ukraine and Romania. Many of them were also stationed in France, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, where they started surrendering themselves to the Allied armies after the Western Front collapsed. A smaller number of them were sent to Finland, North Africa and elsewhere. According to incomplete lists and rough estimates, the Germans conscripted slightly less than 5,000 men from the Celje District into RAD and the army; around 670 of them were killed. Accurate data for Rogaška Slatina are still being determined.</p></div><figure id="figure-15x-en"><img class="imageviewer" style="height:600px;" src="https://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh02/exh02-Meje-pano7-image1-normal.jpg" data-high-res-src="https://www2.sistory.si/publikacije/razstave/Okupacijske_meje/Pictures/exh02/exh02-Meje-pano7-image1.jpg" alt="Immediately after occupation, Germans began the complete Germanisation of the population of Lower Styria.

It promotes the submontane climate (the occupying forces made a mistake there), the healing water and the diet food. Just as the glassworks operated with limited capacity, so did the health resort, which was ran by Director Wolf. In the beginning of May 1942, with the start of the new season, Wolf managed to move the police curfew for guests of the health resort from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Some of the hotel buildings that were part of the health resort's accommodation offer were closed during the winter. Thus, the Ozom Hotel and the Triglav Hotel were still closed in the middle of May 1942.
